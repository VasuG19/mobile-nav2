      This is a quick project to demostrate my skills by building a responsive,
      accessible mobile navigation system that can be toggled on/off using HTML,
      CSS and JavaScript.

      The menu is responsive, so to view the mobile menu, the screen size
      needs to be reduced to less than 770px wide
