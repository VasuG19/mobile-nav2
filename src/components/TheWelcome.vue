  <h1>Home</h1>
    <p>
      This challenge is to demostrate my skills by build a responsive, 
      accessible mobile navigation that can be toggled on/off using HTML, 
      CSS and JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
      The menu is responsive, so to view the mobile menu, the screen size 
      needs to be reduced to less than 770px wide
    </p>
